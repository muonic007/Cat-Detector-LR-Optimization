# Cat-Detector-LR-Optimization
My very first GitHub project! A simple binary classifier that detects cats vs. non-cats, implemented from scratch with NumPy. It also features a learning rate optimization routine. I know there’s still room for improvement, and I’d be happy to hear feedback as I continue learning.
